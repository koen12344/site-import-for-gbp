== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will importing my site be possible after March 2024? =

There will be a short time window after March 2024 to import your site data. But why risk waiting.

= Why does the plugin require such extensive permissions on my Google Business Profile? =

The Google Business Profile API only has a single access level, it is either all or nothing. This is why the plugin asks for such extensive permissions. Ideally we'd ask for as little permissions as possible for the plugin to do the job, but unfortunately there is no way around it. Only endpoints required to read your location data, and import ports/images are implemented. Your access tokens are safely stored within your own WordPress website only.

= What are the limits of this tool? =

The plugin is capped at importing your most recent 100 gallery images and 50 posts from your Google Business Profile
